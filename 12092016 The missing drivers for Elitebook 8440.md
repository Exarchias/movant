#The missing drivers, (the usual suspects) of EliteBook 8440

There are few drivers that always missing when we trying to install a new OS on our laptops (EliteBook 8440), by coisidence i had a flash of inspiration an i isolated the missing driver in to let the drivers to be available for other users who may want to install or reinstall an OS to their Elitebook 8440 laptops. It was suggested to put a description to every driver that i collected, now they are just numbers and to upload them to the common servers. but in order to do that, it is importan to start giving descriptions to every one of them:  
  
- sp46972 Ricoh Media Card Reader Driver
- sp48408 HP ProtectSmart Hard Drive Protection Installer
- sp48432 Intel Chipset Installation Utility 
- sp53806 Intel 82577LM Gigabit Ethernet Driver for Microsoft Windows 
- sp58782 Intel Wireless Drivers for Microsoft Windows 
- sp59624 Validity Fingerprint Sensor Driver
- sp59684 Intel Management Engine Components Driver and Interface  
  
All those drivers will be collected in a folder, (as i have already done) and they will be uploaded to the common file folders that we have in the location //nvt-fs
